Hello everyone, 
In my first class, i learnt about the CIA triad which is also referred to as the "golden egg" of cybersecurity.

The CIA is an abbreviation for Confidentiality, Integrity and, Availability, these three things are what cybersecurity experts aim to protect in a network, system or data.

Confidentiality(Secrecy) is basically putting in measures to ensure that only authorised users have access to certain information. Confidentiality is compromised when unauthorised users gain access to sensitive information.Some measures put in place to ensure confidentiality is not broken are;

1. Encryption: This protects data by conerting it into an unreadable format
2. Access control: This is basically limiting user access based on roles and credentials

Integrity(Trustworthiness) entails making sure that the accuracy of a data is not tempered with and it remains trustworthy throughout its lifecycle. Some meaures put in place to ensure the integrity of a data is not tempered with are;

1. Hashing: This helps verifies that data has not been altered.
2. Checksums and digital signature: This confirms data authenticity and integrity

Availability(Reachability) ensures that data and systems are accessible to authorised whenever needed. Some measures put in place to ensure this are;

1. Regular system maitenance
2. DDOS protrection strategies
